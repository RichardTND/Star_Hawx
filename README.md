# Star_Hawx
Star Hawx is a fun C64 arcade game, inspired by the good old classic arcade games of the very early 1980s. If you remember Galaxian, Galaga or Phoenix, then you are nearly on the right track. Star Hawx is a static screen shoot 'em up, published free on Issue 4 of Zzap 64 Micro Action covermount (September/October 2021). 

The source code for this finished and released game project was written using C64Studio. There is a chance that it may also work on ACME cross assembler. Make sure you have Exomizer handy for compressing the finished production. (Although this has already been set in post-build).

Enjoy.
