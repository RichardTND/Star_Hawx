# Star_Hawx
Star Hawx is a fun C64 arcade game, inspired by the good old classic arcade games of the very early 1980s. If you remember Galaxian, Galaga or Phoenix, then you are nearly on the right track. Star Hawx is a static screen shoot 'em up, published free on Issue 4 of Zzap 64 Micro Action covermount (September/October 2021). 

# What's it all about

This is a game for 1 player only. Your mission is to fight against the evil Star Hawx by blasting them. You will score a certain value of points depending on the Star Hawk you blast. The Star Hawx will also attempt to avenge and attack your ship. Fire at green eggs for a shield. Joystick down will activate the shield to protect your ship for a short time. Can you complete all 16 levels, fighting wave after wave of those evil space birds or will your space ship become space junk?
